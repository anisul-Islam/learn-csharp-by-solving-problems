Here’s an additional problem that demonstrates how to use the `params` keyword in C#. The `params` keyword allows you to pass a variable number of arguments to a method.

### **Problem 11: Calculate Average**

**Problem:** Write a function `CalculateAverage` that takes a variable number of integer scores as parameters and returns their average. Use the `params` keyword to allow the function to accept any number of scores.

**Solution:**

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static double CalculateAverage(params int[] scores)
    {
        int total = 0;
        foreach (int score in scores)
        {
            total += score;
        }

        return scores.Length > 0 ? (double)total / scores.Length : 0;
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Average of 80, 90, 100: " + CalculateAverage(80, 90, 100));
        Console.WriteLine("Average of 85, 95: " + CalculateAverage(85, 95));
        Console.WriteLine("Average of 70, 75, 80, 85: " + CalculateAverage(70, 75, 80, 85));
        Console.WriteLine("Average with no scores: " + CalculateAverage());
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **`params int[] scores`:** This allows the `CalculateAverage` method to accept any number of integer arguments. The `scores` parameter is treated as an array inside the method.
- **Calculation:** The method calculates the total sum of the scores and then divides by the number of scores to find the average. If no scores are provided, it returns 0.
- **Usage:** The method can be called with a different number of arguments, making it versatile and easy to use.

### Sample Output

```
Average of 80, 90, 100: 90
Average of 85, 95: 90
Average of 70, 75, 80, 85: 77.5
Average with no scores: 0
```

This example helps students understand how to use the `params` keyword to create flexible functions that can handle varying numbers of inputs.

## Topic 7: OOP
## Practice 1: Creating a Simple Student Management System with Validation**

**Objective:** This assignment is designed to help you understand the concepts of classes, objects, constructors, methods, static members, and validation in C#. You will create a simple student management system that demonstrates these concepts while also incorporating validation for student data.

### **Assignment Instructions:**

1. **Create a Class Named `Student`:**

   - Define the `Student` class with the following properties:
     - `Name` (string) - Name of the student.
     - `Age` (int) - Age of the student.
     - `Grade` (double) - Grade of the student.
   - Add validation to ensure:
     - The `Name` is not empty or null.
     - The `Age` is between 5 and 100.
     - The `Grade` is between 0.0 and 100.0.
   - Add a static member to keep track of the total number of students created.

2. **Create a Constructor for the `Student` Class:**

   - The constructor should take the student's name, age, and grade as parameters and initialize the properties accordingly after validation.
   - If validation fails, display an error message and do not increment the student count.
   - Increment the static member that tracks the number of students whenever a new valid student object is created.

3. **Create Methods in the `Student` Class:**

   - Add a method named `DisplayInfo` that prints the student's details in a formatted manner.
   - Add a static method named `DisplayTotalStudents` to display the total number of valid students created.

4. **Create an `App` Class with the Main Method:**

   - Create multiple student objects using the `Student` class.
   - Call the methods of each student object to display their details.
   - Use the static method to display the total number of valid students.

### **Expected Output:**

```
Student Name: Alice
Age: 20
Grade: 85.5
-----------------
Error: Age must be between 5 and 100.
Failed to create student due to invalid data.
Error: Name cannot be empty.
Failed to create student due to invalid data.
Error: Grade must be between 0.0 and 100.0.
Failed to create student due to invalid data.
Student Name: David
Age: 22
Grade: 95
-----------------
Total number of valid students: 2
```

### **Concepts Covered:**

1. **Class**: Definition of the `Student` class with properties.
2. **Object**: Creation of `Student` objects (`student1`, `student2`, `student3`).
3. **Constructor**: Initializes properties and increments the student count.
4. **Method**: `DisplayInfo()` method to show student details.
5. **Static Member**: `totalStudents` to keep track of all students.
6. **Static Method**: `DisplayTotalStudents()` to show the total number of students.

This assignment provides a practical, hands-on approach to understanding how classes, objects, constructors, methods, and static members work together in C#.

## Practice 2: Building a Simple Bank Account System**

**Objective:** This assignment will help you practice defining classes, creating objects, using constructors, properties, and methods in C#. You will create a simple bank account system that demonstrates these concepts.

### **Assignment Instructions:**

1. **Create a Class named `BankAccount`:**
   - Define the `BankAccount` class with the following properties:
     - `AccountHolder` (string) - The name of the account holder.
     - `AccountNumber` (string) - The account number (auto-generated or manually set).
     - `Balance` (double) - The current balance of the account (should only be modified within the class).

2. **Create a Constructor for the `BankAccount` Class:**
   - The constructor should take the account holder's name and initial deposit amount as parameters.
   - It should initialize the account holder's name, set an account number, and set the balance to the initial deposit amount.

## **Problem 6: Vehicle Management System Using the Four Pillars of OOP in C#**

**Objective:** This assignment will help students practice the four main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) — **Encapsulation**, **Abstraction**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism** — in C#. Students will create a simple Vehicle Management System that manages different types of vehicles (Car, Bike, Truck), demonstrating each pillar of OOP.

### **Assignment Instructions**

1. **Create an Abstract Base Class (`Vehicle`)**:
   - This class will serve as the base class for all types of vehicles in the system.
   - Define the following properties: `Model`, `Year`, `FuelType`.
   - Include an abstract method `DisplayInfo()` that must be implemented by derived classes.
   - Include a method `Start()` that displays a start message.

2. **Create Derived Classes (`Car`, `Bike`, and `Truck`) Using Inheritance**:
   - **`Car` Class**:
     - Inherit from `Vehicle`.
     - Add a property `NumberOfDoors`.
     - Implement the `DisplayInfo()` method to display the car’s information.
   - **`Bike` Class**:
     - Inherit from `Vehicle`.
     - Add a property `HasCarrier`.
     - Implement the `DisplayInfo()` method to display the bike’s information.
   - **`Truck` Class**:
     - Inherit from `Vehicle`.
     - Add a property `LoadCapacity`.
     - Implement the `DisplayInfo()` method to display the truck’s information.

3. **Encapsulation**:
   - Use private fields and public properties to encapsulate data within classes.
   - Implement methods to manage specific behaviors of each vehicle type.

4. **Abstraction**:
   - Use abstract classes and methods to define common structure and behavior for all vehicles.
   - Define an interface `IServiceable` that contains methods like `Service()` which will be implemented by all derived classes.

5. **Polymorphism**:
   - Demonstrate polymorphism by creating a method that accepts `Vehicle` objects and calls the `DisplayInfo()` method.
   - Show how different vehicle types interact with the system through polymorphic behavior.

6. **Main Program**:
   - Create instances of `Car`, `Bike`, and `Truck`.
   - Demonstrate calling their methods, especially focusing on polymorphic behavior.


### **Key Concepts Demonstrated in the Assignment:**

1. **Encapsulation**:
   - Fields such as `model`, `year`, `fuelType`, `numberOfDoors`, `hasCarrier`, and `loadCapacity` are encapsulated within their respective classes.

2. **Abstraction**:
   - The `Vehicle` class is abstract, defining a contract for common behavior without specifying the implementation.
   - The `IServiceable` interface abstracts the service action that all vehicles must provide.

3. **Inheritance**:
   - `Car`, `Bike`, and `Truck` inherit from `Vehicle`, reusing base class functionality and adding specific features.

4. **Polymorphism**:
   - The overridden `DisplayInfo()` method demonstrates different outputs based on the object type (Car, Bike, Truck).
   - The `Start()` method shows shared behavior among all vehicles.

### **Expected Output:**

```
Toyota Corolla is starting.
Car Model: Toyota Corolla, Year: 2022, Fuel Type: Petrol, Doors: 4

Yamaha is starting.
Bike Model: Yamaha, Year: 2020, Fuel Type: Petrol, Carrier: Yes

Volvo is starting.
Truck Model: Volvo, Year: 2021, Fuel Type: Diesel, Load Capacity: 15.5 tons

Car Model: Toyota Corolla, Year: 2022, Fuel Type: Petrol, Doors: 4
Toyota Corolla car is being serviced.
Bike Model: Yamaha, Year: 2020, Fuel Type: Petrol, Carrier: Yes
Yamaha bike is being serviced.
Truck Model: Volvo, Year: 2021, Fuel Type: Diesel, Load Capacity: 15.5 tons
Volvo truck is being serviced.
```

### **Summary of the Assignment:**

This assignment helps students practice and understand the four pillars of OOP in C#:
- **Encapsulation** keeps data within classes secure and manageable.
- **Abstraction** hides complex implementation details while providing essential interfaces.
- **Inheritance** allows new classes to reuse and extend existing class functionality.
- **Polymorphism** enables flexible and dynamic method invocation based on object types.

This practical approach helps students learn how these OOP concepts work together in a cohesive and real-world application scenario.

              // Demonstrate polymorphism by calling methods on the abstract type
              savings.DisplayAccountInfo();
              savings.CalculateInterest();
      
              Console.WriteLine();
      
              checking.DisplayAccountInfo();
              checking.Withdraw(600);  // Demonstrate overdraft

**Objective:** This assignment will help students practice the four main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) — **Encapsulation**, **Abstraction**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism** — in C#. Students will build a basic School Management System with classes representing people in a school (Person, Student, Teacher), demonstrating each pillar of OOP.

### **Assignment Instructions**

1. **Create an Abstract Base Class (`Person`)**:
   - This class will serve as the foundation for all other types of people in the school.
   - Define the following properties: `Name`, `Age`.
   - Include an abstract method `DisplayInfo()` that must be implemented by derived classes.
   - Include a method `Greet()` that displays a greeting message.

2. **Create Derived Classes (`Student` and `Teacher`) Using Inheritance**:
   - **`Student` Class**:
     - Inherit from `Person`.
     - Add a property `StudentID`.
     - Implement the `DisplayInfo()` method to display the student’s information.
   - **`Teacher` Class**:
     - Inherit from `Person`.
     - Add a property `Subject`.
     - Implement the `DisplayInfo()` method to display the teacher’s information.

3. **Encapsulation**:
   - Use encapsulated fields with private access modifiers where appropriate.
   - Use properties to manage access to private fields.

4. **Abstraction**:
   - Use abstract classes and methods to define common behavior for all people in the school.
   - Define an interface `ISchoolMember` that contains a method `GetRole()` which will be implemented by `Student` and `Teacher`.

5. **Polymorphism**:
   - Demonstrate polymorphism by creating a method that accepts `Person` objects and calls the `DisplayInfo()` method.
   - Show how polymorphism works with the `GetRole()` method from the `ISchoolMember` interface.

6. **Main Program**:
   - Create instances of `Student` and `Teacher`.
   - Demonstrate calling their methods, especially focusing on polymorphic behavior.

### **Expected Output**:

Your code should demonstrate the concepts of OOP by showing how objects interact with each other using the four pillars of OOP.

### **Key Concepts Demonstrated in the Assignment:**

1. **Encapsulation**:
   - The `name`, `age`, `studentID`, and `subject` fields are encapsulated within their respective classes, accessible only through properties.

2. **Abstraction**:
   - The `Person` class is abstract, defining a contract for common behavior without specifying the implementation.
   - The `ISchoolMember` interface further abstracts roles, requiring derived classes to specify their own roles.

3. **Inheritance**:
   - `Student` and `Teacher` inherit from `Person`, reusing the base class functionality and adding their own specific features.

4. **Polymorphism**:
   - The overridden `DisplayInfo()` method shows different outputs depending on whether the object is a `Student` or a `Teacher`.
   - The `Greet()` method is the same for both, demonstrating shared behavior.

### **Expected Output:**

```
Hello, my name is Alice.
Student Name: Alice, Age: 20, ID: S1234

Hello, my name is Mr. Brown.
Teacher Name: Mr. Brown, Age: 40, Subject: Mathematics

Student:
Student Name: Alice, Age: 20, ID: S1234
Teacher:
Teacher Name: Mr. Brown, Age: 40, Subject: Mathematics
```

### **Summary of the Assignment:**

This assignment helps students practice and understand the four pillars of OOP in C#:
- **Encapsulation** keeps data secure within classes.
- **Abstraction** hides complex details and exposes only necessary parts.
- **Inheritance** allows classes to build on one another.
- **Polymorphism** lets objects be treated as their base type, simplifying code and enhancing flexibility.

This practical approach helps students grasp how these concepts interconnect and are applied in real-world programming scenarios.
